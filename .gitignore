# Lavalink Server Directory
# Note: Lavalink.jar is large - consider using Railway's file upload instead of git

# If you want to track the jar in git, remove this line
# Lavalink.jar

# But it's better to download it on Railway or use a build step
# Railway can download it during deployment if needed
