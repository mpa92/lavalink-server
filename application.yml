    # Client order: Try clients that work without OAuth first, then fallback to WEB if needed
    # Direct YouTube URLs work with these, but Spotify mirroring may need different clients
    clients:
      - "TVHTML5EMBEDDED"    # TV embedded - works for direct URLs, may not need OAuth
      - "MUSIC"              # YouTube Music - often works without full OAuth
      - "ANDROID"            # Android - may require OAuth for some content
      - "ANDROID_MUSIC"      # Android Music - may require OAuth
      - "WEB"                # Last resort - requires cipher but works when others fail
    # OAuth enabled but may need Google OAuth credentials for full functionality
    # For now, clients that don't require it should work for most content

    # Provider priority: ISRC-based searches first (more reliable), then queries

      - "ytsearch:\"%ISRC%\""   # YouTube by ISRC (fallback with ISRC)
