    # Prefer clients that don't require fragile WEB signature deciphering
    # Order: most reliable first (no cipher needed) to least reliable (requires cipher)
    clients:
      - "ANDROID"           # Android client - no cipher required
      - "ANDROID_MUSIC"     # Android Music client - stable, no cipher
      - "TVHTML5EMBEDDED"    # TV embedded client - good fallback
      - "MUSIC"              # YouTube Music client - may bypass some cipher
    # WEB client excluded - requires signature extraction that's currently broken

    # Provider priority: ISRC-based searches first (more reliable), then queries
    # ISRC-based searches use direct track matching which can avoid some YouTube cipher issues
    providers:
      - "ytmsearch:\"%ISRC%\""  # YouTube Music by ISRC (direct match, more reliable)
      - "ytsearch:\"%ISRC%\""   # YouTube by ISRC (fallback with ISRC)
      - "ytmsearch:\"%QUERY%\"" # YouTube Music by query (last resort for music)
      - "ytsearch:\"%QUERY%\""  # YouTube by query (final fallback)
